# SkilledAt.Work — canonical source and asset handling

This document records source ownership for issue #72. It supplements the detailed [consolidation inventory](CONSOLIDATION-INVENTORY-2026-11-08.md). It does not certify production deployment.

## Source-of-truth map

| Capability | Canonical tracked source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Browser and learner/admin interfaces | `lms-main/apps/frontend/src/` | Active Next.js application |
| API and service authorization | `lms-main/apps/backend/src/` | Active Express application |
| Persistence and migrations | `lms-main/apps/backend/prisma/` | Active **until** Central #68 migration is agreed |
| Canonical authored curriculum | `lms-main/curriculum/courses/`, `shared/` | Requires lesson-level review/approval |
| Derived lesson index | `lms-main/curriculum/lesson-normalization-index.json` | Regenerate with `node scripts/reconcile-lesson-formats.mjs`; never edit manually |
| Training visuals | `brand/`, `library/` at repository root | Canonical tracked images |
| Frontend public visuals | `lms-main/apps/frontend/public/academy/` | **Generated copy**; gitignored, not canonical |
| Archived compressed imports | Root historical ZIPs | Source provenance only; do not build or install from them |
| Historical pass reports | `lms-main/PASS*`, `docs/legacy-bootstrap/` | Provenance/reference, not active executable setup |
| Inactive package placeholder | `lms-main/packages/shared/` | Do not remove until workspace/lockfile migrations are reviewed |

## Repeatable asset materialisation

Run from `lms-main/`:

```sh
node scripts/prepare-public-assets.mjs
node scripts/prepare-public-assets.mjs --check
node --test scripts/test-prepare-public-assets.mjs
```

The script copies both repository-root `brand/` and `library/` into `apps/frontend/public/academy/`, keeping paths unchanged. Frontend `predev` and `prebuild` scripts call it automatically. Missing source folders and symlinked source files fail closed. If an existing output file has different bytes, the script **fails instead of overwriting it**. Existing matching files are reused. Source images are never moved or deleted.

Run after cloning a full checkout that includes `brand/` and `library/`. Deploy the complete built Next public output, including the generated `academy/` directory; deployment packaging to an actual host is **not verified**. The public site URL remains environment-configured, not assumed.

## Consolidation constraints

- Keep license and source attribution. Old `Titan Academy` labels in provenance are not the current product name.
- Do not relocate migration history or rename Prisma tables, routes, role enums or `@lms/*` package keys without tested compatibility migrations.
- Root ZIPs may be redundant but have not been deleted; archive weight tracked by issue #42.
- Tutor chatbot, certificates and runbooks have potential overlapping implementations: see inventory sections 6–9. Their behavior must be compared before deduplication.
- Curriculum publication gates, identity scoping, assessor approvals and evidence records are not affected by this asset copy change.
- A successful asset unit test is **not** proof of image availability on a production server. Verify deployment artifacts separately.
